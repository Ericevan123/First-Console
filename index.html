        <p style="font-size: 23px;">Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to
           develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual
           Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows
           Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code
           and managed code.</p>

           <p style="font-size: 23px;">A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which
              the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a
              monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used
              to control one or more servers.</p>
